hey

thanks for stopping by dopflush. this is a personal blog to keep track of my health and reflect on my path to recovery. it's been a hard journey for the past 5 years or so, and i'd like to commit to something that can lead to long term success. there will be daily updates to the tracker and weekly reflections on my progress.

today is the last day i consumed p*rn. not a fun time, but i'm looking forward to what is to come. 

I'm doing this for:
- my family
- my past self
- my future self
- and anyone else who cares about me.

-df
