i want to make it clear at the end of day why does this all matter. p\*rn has impacted my physical, psychological, and emotional health. The reduced energy has made it hard for me to focus and follow through with my responsibilities including my academic performance. It's made me feel weaker overall; i have slept less which means less energy and motivation to just do things and accomplishmy goals. it's made me bitter and hard to talk to. people around me experience me snapping at the littlest things. overall, its taken away from me what i could have become. im approaching my prime and i want to make the most of it, if i cant even push myself beyond this obstacle, i'll just be frustrated with myself forever. this is for me, my friends and my family, all of whom deserve the best from me.
