yesterday went well entertained some thoughts tho but nothing really happened. this morning i "thought" again a lil bit but it didn't work. when i came back home and sat down around 10pm it happened again and the cycle returned. twice too so yesterday doesn't evencount. im going to go sleep but its not working so far because i kind of forget the effort im trying to make. im writing down my current routine goals so i commit to something overall. ill edit this in a bit.
