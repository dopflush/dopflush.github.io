holy shit,

i didnt even last 24 hours. how fucked is that. i really gotta change my strategy. im no longer working in my room anymore. if i ever have to do work im going to the nearby hotel and im commiting to that. its genuinely so frustrating. i can't even keep a promise to myself. alright, plan tomorrow commit going to bed by 10 pm no excuses.

ill put updates here as i get more thoughts
